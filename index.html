                If you're trying to achieve, there will be roadblocks. I've had them; everybody has had them. But
                obstacles don't have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. Figure out how
                to climb it, go through it, or work around it.

                It's heavy duty to try to do everything and please everybody. My job was to go out there and play the
                game of basketball as best I can. People may not agree with that. I can’t live with what everyone's
                impression of what I should or what I shouldn't do.

                Champions do not become champions when they win an event, but in the hours, weeks, and months, and years
                they spend preparing for it. The victorious performance itself is merely a demonstration of their
                championship character.

                Be true to the game, because the game will be true to you. If you try to shortcut the game, then the
                game will shortcut you. If you put forth the effort, good things will be bestowed upon you. That’s truly
